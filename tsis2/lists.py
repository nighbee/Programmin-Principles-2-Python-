List Items
  List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
  List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
Ordered
  When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
  If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
  Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
Changeable
  The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
Allow Duplicates
  Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

gr = int(input())
ou = gr*28.33
print(ou)
